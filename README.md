Since the original White-Ops-6 repo hasn't been active in a few months, I forked it and will do my best to keep it updated. Keep in mind, I am usually at work when the game updates to it takes me a little longer to step aside, dump the binary, then get the offsets and decryptions. Please be patient or just wait for the forums! This is something a majority of us do for free and in our own free time.
